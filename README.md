About Me
I'm a highly motivated individual with a passion for technology and a background in international business. With experience in project management and client-facing roles, I have developed excellent communication and organizational skills.

Recently, I decided to shift my career towards technology and have been developing my technical skills through various projects, including web development, data analysis, and software engineering. I have a degree in International Business from Sheffield Hallam University and have completed online courses in programming languages such as C# and JavaScript.

I enjoy working on challenging projects that require creativity and problem-solving skills, and I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and grow. I'm a fast learner, a team player, and always strive to deliver high-quality work.

When I'm not coding, you can find me watching football, playing CS:GO, or traveling.
